# My First Portfolio


## Description
This project was created when I only had two weeks of experience in web development. I completed this much with a weeks worth of time using a newly acquired understanding of **HTML 5**, **CSS 3** , and **JQuery**.
## Technologies
**JQuery** was used to generate animations for the UX, **HTML 5** was the scaffodling, **CSS 3** was used to design the user interface and **Bootstrap** was used for the modals.
